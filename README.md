## VNN Neural Network Verification Competition (VNN-COMP 2022) Version

Source code (written in Python3) is in the /src/ directory. Three bash scripts have been defined in the /vnncomp_scripts/ directory as per competition rules.

1. The script install_tool.sh installs the tool, prerequisites included. (No manual installation steps needed.)
2. The script prepare_instance.sh prepares an instance to be executed.
3. The script run_instance.sh runs the tool on a given instance and stores the result in a plaintext file.
